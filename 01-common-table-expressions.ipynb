They are defined using the WITH keyword and are useful for creating complex queries that are easier to read and maintain.  They are a little bit like context managers in Python, but for SQL!"

    "## Why Use CTEs?\n",
    "\n",
    "CTEs are useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: CTEs can make complex queries easier to read and understand by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: CTEs can be referenced multiple times within a query, allowing you to reuse the same logic in different parts of the query.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: CTEs can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan.\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: CTEs can be used to isolate and test specific parts of a query, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "5. **Recursive Queries**: CTEs can be used to create recursive queries that reference themselves, allowing you to work with hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "6. **Window Functions**: CTEs can be used in conjunction with window functions to perform complex analytical queries. (Window functions are a powerful feature of SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.)\n",
    "7. **Data Transformation**: CTEs can be used to transform data in a query, such as aggregating, filtering, or joining data from multiple tables."

    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for CTEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Queries**: CTEs can be used to create recursive queries that reference themselves, allowing you to work with hierarchical data structures such as organizational charts, bill of materials, or social networks.\n",
    "2. **Reusable Queries**: CTEs can be used to define reusable subqueries that can be referenced multiple times within a query, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: CTEs can be used to transform data in a query, such as aggregating, filtering, or joining data from multiple tables.\n",

    "Here is an example of a ***recursive*** CTE that generates a list of all employees and their managers in an organizational chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (\n",
    "    SELECT employee_id, manager_id\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE manager_id IS NULL\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id\n",
    "    FROM employees e\n",
    "    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM employee_hierarchy;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial query selects the root node of the hierarchy (employees with no manager).\n",
    "- The recursive part of the query joins the employees table with the CTE to find the direct reports of each manager.\n",
    "- The UNION ALL operator combines the results of the initial query and the recursive part to generate the final result set.\n",
    "- The SELECT statement at the end retrieves the final result set.\n",
    "- The query will continue to execute recursively until all levels of the hierarchy have been processed."
